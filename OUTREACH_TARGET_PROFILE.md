# AI Cost Explainer - Target Profile for Outreach

## DECISION MAKERS TO TARGET

### Priority 1 (Direct Buyers):
- **CTO / Chief Technology Officer**
- **VP of Engineering**
- **Head of Engineering**
- **Director of Engineering**
- **Engineering Manager** (if team >10)
- **Lead Developer / Tech Lead** (influencer)

### Priority 2 (Budget Holders):
- **CFO** (if engineering spend >£10k/mo)
- **VP of Product** (if AI is product feature)
- **Founder/CEO** (if <20 employees)

### Red Flags (Don't Target):
- **Junior developers** (no budget authority)
- **Data Scientists** (usually not API spend owners)
- **Enterprise companies >500 employees** (procurement nightmare, use vendors not £299 audits)
- **Non-tech industries** (law firms, hospitals - compliance slows everything)

---

## COMPANY FIT CRITERIA

### Perfect Fit (A+):
- **Stage:** Series A or B (raised £2m-£20m)
- **Team:** 15-100 employees, 5-30 engineers
- **Signal:** Job posting for "AI Engineer" or "LLM" or "OpenAI"
- **Spend:** £2k-£50k/month on AI APIs (enough to hurt, not enough for enterprise tools)
- **Stack:** Using OpenAI directly (not via Azure/Anthropic-only)
- **Growth:** Hiring 3+ engineers this quarter (burn rate focus)

### Good Fit (B):
- **Seed stage** but product-market fit (revenue >£50k MRR)
- **Agencies** with multiple AI clients
- **Bootstrapped SaaS** with >£100k ARR
- **Y Combinator alumni** (even current batch)

### Poor Fit (Avoid):
- **Pre-revenue startups** (no money for £299)
- **Enterprise** (>200 employees, need procurement approval)
- **Pure Anthropic/Google shops** (wrong data format)
- **Non-software businesses** using AI for tiny edge cases

## INDUSTRY VERTICALS (Ranked)

### 1. SaaS/Productivity Tools ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Project management apps with AI features

- Code assistants
- CRM with AI features
- **Why:** Heavy API usage, margin-sensitive, technical buyers

### 2. Marketing/AdTech ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Content generation platforms
- Ad optimization tools
- SEO tools with AI features
- **Why:** High volume usage, cost directly impacts margins

### 3. Fintech ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Automated analysis tools
- Customer support bots
- Document processing
- **Why:** Regulated but cost-conscious, Series A/B heavy

### 4. HealthTech (Careful) ⭐⭐⭐
- Patient communication tools

- **Why:** High usage, but compliance slows sales

### 5. Marketplaces ⭐⭐⭐
- Customer support automation
- Listing generation
- **Why:** High volume, thin margins

### Avoid:
- **Crypto/Web3** (volatile budgets)
- **Hardware/IoT** (wrong buyer profile)

## PERSONALIZATION TRIGGERS (For Outreach)

### Look for these on their profile/company:
- Recently posted about AI features launched
- Job postings for AI roles (means they're scaling usage)
- Series A/B funding announcement (new budget but cost pressure)
- "We're hiring 10 engineers" (burn rate concern)
- Posted about "infrastructure costs" or "optimization"
- Y Combinator badge in bio

### Conversation Starters:
- "Saw you just raised Series A and are hiring AI engineers..."
- "Noticed [Company] launched AI features last month..."
- "Your job posting for LLM Engineer suggests you're scaling fast..."

---

## OUTREACH TEMPLATE (Use This)

### Connection Request:
```
Hi [Name], saw [Company] is scaling the AI engineering team post-Series A. 

We're helping similar startups cut 30-40% off OpenAI bills without touching their prompts - usually pays for itself in the first month.

Worth a connection?
```

### Follow-up (if accepted):
```
Thanks for connecting [Name]. 

Quick question: Is your team feeling the OpenAI bill pinch yet? We just helped a [similar company] cut theirs from £8k to £3k/month with some simple routing changes.

Happy to share the specific fixes if useful, no obligation.
```

### The Ask:
```
Would it be worth me taking a quick look at your usage CSV? Takes 2 mins to spot the biggest opportunities.

If I can't find £1k+ in savings, you pay nothing. If I do, it's £299 for the full audit + implementation code.

Worth a shot?
```

---

## OUTREACH TRACKER

### Daily Targets:
- **10 connection requests/day**
- **Focus:** Series A/B + "AI" in company description
- **Geography:** UK/EU timezone (easier to service)
- **Avoid:** Anyone with "Enterprise" or "Global" in their title (too big)

### Success Metrics:
- Connection acceptance rate >30%
- Response rate to follow-up >20%
- Conversion to audit >5%
- Average deal size: £299

### Tools Needed:
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- CSV tracker for prospects
- Email templates for follow-ups

2. **Clear ROI:** £299 audit can save £1k+ monthly
3. **Low Friction:** No long sales cycles, instant value
4. **Technical Credibility:** Real code fixes, not just consulting

### Differentiators:
