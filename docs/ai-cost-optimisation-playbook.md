# AI Cost Optimisation Playbook
## DIY Audit System Template

### 1. Product Overview

AI Cost Optimisation Playbook is a structured system + spreadsheet toolkit that helps companies:

- Upload OpenAI usage data (CSV export)
- Identify token waste and inefficient model usage
- Detect overpowered model selection
- Analyse request patterns
- Estimate optimisation savings
- Generate a clear action plan to reduce AI spend

This product is a DIY version of the £299 Expert Audit, designed as a lower-ticket entry product and funnel into the full audit service.

### 2. Target Customer

**SaaS founders using OpenAI API**
**AI startups scaling usage**
**Agencies building AI automations**
**Product teams with rising token costs**
**Technical founders who want control over margins**

**Primary pain:**
"Our OpenAI bill keeps increasing and we don't know why."

### 3. Core Value Proposition

Instead of guessing why costs are rising, this system:

- Quantifies inefficiency
- Highlights optimisation opportunities
- Creates a structured action roadmap
- Provides estimated monthly savings

**Outcome:**
Clear, measurable reduction in AI spend.

### 4. Product Components

#### 4.1 Spreadsheet System (Core Asset)

**Sections:**

**A. Raw Upload Sheet**

### 7. Funnel Strategy

#### Entry Product:
AI Cost Optimisation Playbook (£49–£99)

#### Upsell:
After user completes analysis:

"Want us to implement this for you?
Get a full Expert Audit with tailored optimisation plan → £299"

**Position Expert Audit as:**
- Custom implementation
- Strategic roadmap
- Personalised optimisation
- Advanced savings modelling

### 8. Integration with Existing Project

1. User buys Playbook
2. Uploads CSV and runs self-analysis
3. Sees estimated savings
4. Realises optimisation is complex
5. Upgrades to Expert Audit

**This creates:**
Low friction entry → Trust → Premium upsell

### 9. MVP Build Scope (Lean Version)

**Phase 1:**
- Google Sheets / Excel template
- Clean dashboard
- Basic savings estimator
- PDF optimisation framework

**Phase 2:**
- Web-based upload interface
- Auto-parsing tool
- Visual cost breakdown charts
- Direct upsell CTA integration

### 10. Strategic Benefits

- Generates recurring inbound
- Qualifies serious buyers
- Pre-educates customers before audit
- Increases close rate for £299 offer
- Builds authority in AI cost optimisation niche

### 11. Long-Term Expansion

**Future upgrades:**
- Monthly monitoring subscription
- Slack alerts for spend spikes
- Automated optimisation engine
- Agency license version
- White-label version

### Core Strategic Thesis

Most companies treat AI spend as:

"Just part of infra."

This product reframes it as:

"A controllable margin lever."

That positioning makes this a durable category, not a trend product.
